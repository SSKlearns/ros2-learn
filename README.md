# ros2-learn

The Robotic Operating System is a set of tools to build robot applications. This repo documents my progress as I follow the documentation tutorials and eventually build my own project.

I'm running ROS2 Humble in a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container.

You can follow the steps <a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Run-2-nodes-in-single-or-separate-docker-containers.html">here</a> to set up the environment yourself.
