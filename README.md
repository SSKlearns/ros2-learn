    The Robotic Operating System is a set of tools to build robot applications. ROS2 humble is a part of my college coursework and this repo documents my progress as I follow the documentation tutorials and eventually build my own project.

    I have set up ROS2 humble on my laptop using a <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> container.

    You can follow the steps from the ROS2 Humble website's How-To Guides or click on the link <a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Run-2-nodes-in-single-or-separate-docker-containers.html" target="_blank">here</a> to set up the environment yourself.
